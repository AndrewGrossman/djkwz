      \ large tables. This allows the index to determine which blocks are the only\
      \ ones worth\r\nchecking, and all others can be skipped. So if a 10GB table\
      \ of order contained rows that were generally\r\nin order of order date, a BRIN\
      \ index on the order_date column would allow the majority of the table to be\r\
